### **Memory Management: Basic Concept**

Memory management is an essential function of an operating system that handles the system’s memory resources. It is responsible for allocating memory to processes, ensuring that each process gets the required memory while preventing conflicts between processes. The objective of memory management is to provide an efficient and safe way to store and retrieve data in memory, ensuring that the system operates correctly and efficiently.

Key responsibilities of memory management include:
- **Allocation**: Assigning memory space to processes when they require it.
- **Deallocation**: Releasing memory when processes no longer need it.
- **Tracking**: Monitoring memory usage to prevent issues like fragmentation and overuse of memory.
- **Protection**: Ensuring that a process does not access memory that it has not been allocated, preventing crashes and security issues.
- **Swapping**: Moving processes in and out of main memory when physical memory is insufficient, often done through a technique known as **virtual memory**.

### **Logical and Physical Address Map**

Memory in a computer system can be divided into two types of addresses:
1. **Logical Address (or Virtual Address)**
2. **Physical Address**

#### **1. Logical Address (Virtual Address)**:
- The logical address refers to the address generated by the CPU during the execution of a program.
- This is the address that a process sees and uses to access memory.
- The operating system provides a **virtual memory** mechanism, which allows the process to use logical addresses, and it maps them to the corresponding physical addresses in real memory.

#### **2. Physical Address**:
- The physical address is the actual address in the main memory (RAM) where data or instructions are stored.
- The operating system and memory management hardware (such as the **Memory Management Unit**, MMU) map logical addresses to physical addresses when processes access memory.

#### **Address Mapping Process**:
The operating system uses a process called **address translation** to convert logical addresses to physical addresses. This translation is done using a **page table** or **segment table** based on the memory management scheme in use.

- **In a Paging System**:
  - The logical address is divided into two parts: the **page number** and the **offset**.
  - The page number is used as an index into a **page table**, which gives the base physical address of the page in main memory.
  - The offset specifies the exact location within the page.

- **In a Segmentation System**:
  - The logical address is divided into two parts: the **segment number** and the **offset**.
  - The segment number is used to look up a **segment table** that provides the starting physical address of the segment.
  - The offset is used to access the exact location within the segment.

#### **Example of Address Mapping**:

Let's consider a process trying to access memory at a logical address:

- **Logical Address (Virtual Address)** = 0xABCDE
  - **Page Number (for paging)** = 0xABC
  - **Offset** = 0xDE

The operating system will check the page table for the page number 0xABC to determine the corresponding physical page number, say 0x123. The final physical address will be the base address of page 0x123 plus the offset 0xDE.

#### **Memory Management Units (MMU)**:
- The **MMU** is responsible for translating the logical address into the physical address.
- It uses the page table (in paging) or the segment table (in segmentation) to perform the translation.
- The MMU automatically translates the addresses as the program executes, ensuring that the program uses only the logical address space and not the physical memory directly.

#### **Memory Protection**:
- The operating system uses the concept of logical and physical addresses to implement memory protection.
- Since processes only access logical addresses, they cannot directly modify other processes' memory, protecting each process from interfering with others.

### **Summary of the Address Mapping Concept**:

| Concept                 | Logical Address                                   | Physical Address                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**           | The address generated by the CPU during execution. | The actual address in physical memory (RAM).    |
| **Visibility**           | Seen by the process.                             | Seen by the hardware.                           |
| **Mapping**              | Mapped to physical addresses by the operating system. | Accessed directly by hardware.                 |
| **Address Translation**  | Translated to physical addresses using page tables (paging) or segment tables (segmentation). | Direct access by the system.                    |

Memory management, especially with logical and physical address mapping, ensures that processes are isolated from one another, that memory is used efficiently, and that the operating system can handle limited physical memory with the help of techniques like paging and segmentation.

### **Memory Allocation: Contiguous Memory Allocation**

Contiguous memory allocation is a memory management scheme where each process is assigned a single contiguous block of memory. This means that a process occupies a set of consecutive memory locations, which simplifies memory allocation and access. However, it comes with several challenges, particularly with memory fragmentation.

---

### **Types of Contiguous Memory Allocation**

1. **Fixed Partition Allocation**:
   - In fixed partition allocation, the memory is divided into a fixed number of partitions, each with a predetermined size. The partitions are created during system startup and cannot be resized.
   - Each process is assigned to one partition, and the operating system maintains a table to track the allocation of these partitions.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Simple to implement.
     - Memory allocation is quick since the partitions are fixed.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - **Internal Fragmentation**: If a process doesn't completely fill a partition, the remaining memory within that partition is wasted.
     - **Inflexible**: Fixed partition sizes might not fit all processes, leading to inefficient memory usage.

   **Example**:
   - If memory is divided into 4 partitions of sizes 100MB, and a process of size 120MB is to be allocated, it will not fit into any partition, even though the total free memory is 400MB.

2. **Variable Partition Allocation**:
   - In variable partition allocation, memory is divided into partitions of different sizes based on the needs of the process. When a process is loaded, a partition is dynamically created to fit the process size.
   - **Advantages**:
     - More flexible than fixed partitioning.
     - It can accommodate processes of different sizes more efficiently.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - **External Fragmentation**: As processes are loaded and unloaded, free memory is scattered in small chunks throughout the system, making it difficult to allocate large contiguous memory blocks to new processes.

   **Example**:
   - If processes of varying sizes are loaded and unloaded from memory, gaps of free memory may appear between allocated regions, which may not be useful for new large processes.

---

### **Fragmentation**

Fragmentation occurs when free memory is divided into small, non-contiguous blocks, making it difficult to allocate larger chunks of memory even though the total free memory is sufficient. There are two types of fragmentation:

1. **Internal Fragmentation**:
   - Occurs when memory is allocated in fixed-size blocks, and the allocated block is larger than the actual memory required by the process. The leftover memory in the block is wasted.
   - Commonly seen in **fixed partitioning** schemes where the memory allocated to a process may not be fully used, leaving unused space within the partition.
   
   **Example**:
   - If a fixed partition of 100MB is assigned to a process that requires only 60MB, the remaining 40MB is wasted and cannot be used by other processes.

2. **External Fragmentation**:
   - Occurs in **variable partitioning** schemes where free memory is scattered throughout the system in small chunks, and large processes cannot be allocated due to insufficient contiguous space.
   - Even though the total free memory might be sufficient for a process, the lack of a single contiguous block of free memory prevents its allocation.

   **Example**:
   - If a system has 100MB of free space, but it is divided into several smaller free blocks (e.g., 20MB, 30MB, and 50MB), and a process needs 80MB, it cannot be allocated despite sufficient total free space.

---

### **Compaction**

**Compaction** is a technique used to reduce **external fragmentation** by moving processes in memory to consolidate free space into a contiguous block. This involves shifting the processes in memory to eliminate gaps between them. After compaction, a larger contiguous block of free memory is available, allowing processes that require larger blocks to be allocated.

- **How it works**: The operating system periodically performs compaction to move all processes toward one end of memory, creating a large free block at the other end. However, compaction is computationally expensive because it involves copying data from one memory location to another.
- **Limitations**:
  - Compaction increases the CPU overhead as it requires moving processes around.
  - It can cause a performance hit if done frequently, as the processes must be rearranged in memory.

---

### **Summary of Memory Allocation and Fragmentation**

| Type of Memory Allocation        | Fixed Partition | Variable Partition |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Memory Allocation**             | Fixed size partitions | Dynamic size partitions |
| **Internal Fragmentation**        | Yes             | Possible (but less) |
| **External Fragmentation**        | No              | Yes                |
| **Example of Allocation Scheme**  | Partition sizes are fixed | Processes are dynamically allocated based on size |
| **Compaction Needed**             | No              | Yes                |

| Type of Fragmentation             | Internal Fragmentation | External Fragmentation |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Cause**                         | Wasted space within a fixed partition | Small, scattered free spaces |
| **Solution**                      | Reduce partition size, use variable partitioning | Compaction, paging, segmentation |

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Fixed Partitioning** is simpler but leads to internal fragmentation, while **Variable Partitioning** is more flexible but can suffer from external fragmentation.
- **Compaction** helps manage external fragmentation but comes with performance overhead.
- In modern systems, techniques like **paging** and **segmentation** are used to minimize fragmentation and optimize memory usage.

### **Paging: Principle of Operation**

**Paging** is a memory management scheme that eliminates the problems of **external fragmentation** and helps manage memory more efficiently. In paging, both the logical (virtual) memory and physical memory are divided into small fixed-size blocks. 

- **Logical memory** is divided into blocks of equal size called **pages**.
- **Physical memory** is divided into blocks of the same size called **frames**.

Pages are mapped to frames in physical memory, allowing a process's data to be stored non-contiguously. This mapping is done via a **page table**, which maintains the mapping between the logical pages and physical frames.

#### **How Paging Works**:
1. When a process is created, the operating system divides the process's logical memory into **pages**.
2. Physical memory is divided into **frames** of the same size as the pages.
3. A **page table** is used to store the mapping of pages to frames. Each entry in the page table holds the base address of the corresponding frame in physical memory.
4. When a process accesses a logical address, the **page number** is used to look up the corresponding **frame number** in the page table. The **offset** is then combined with the base address of the frame to get the exact physical address.

**Example**:
- Suppose a page table maps page 3 to frame 5. If a process generates a logical address of page 3, offset 20, the page table tells the OS that page 3 maps to frame 5. The physical address will then be `frame 5 + offset 20`.

---

### **Page Allocation**

In paging, memory is allocated in **fixed-size blocks**. These blocks are referred to as **pages** in logical memory and **frames** in physical memory.

#### **Page Table**:
The **page table** is responsible for mapping logical pages to physical frames. It contains an entry for each page in the logical address space. Each entry contains the base address of the corresponding physical frame.

There are two common types of page tables:
1. **Single-Level Page Table**: A simple one-to-one mapping of pages to frames.
2. **Multi-Level Page Table**: Used when the address space is large. This reduces the size of the page table by organizing it into levels, where each level contains part of the page's address mapping.

**Page Allocation Process**:
- When a process is loaded into memory, the operating system allocates a certain number of frames to hold the pages of the process.
- These frames are assigned from the pool of free physical memory frames, and the page table is updated to reflect the mapping between the logical pages and the physical frames.

---

### **Hardware Support for Paging**

The **Memory Management Unit (MMU)** plays a crucial role in the hardware support for paging. The MMU handles the translation from logical addresses to physical addresses using the page table.

#### **Key Components**:
1. **Page Table**: A table that stores the mapping of logical pages to physical frames.
2. **Page Table Base Register (PTBR)**: A register in the MMU that holds the base address of the page table.
3. **Page Table Entry (PTE)**: Each entry in the page table holds the base address of the corresponding frame in physical memory.

#### **Page Table Lookup**:
- When the CPU generates a logical address (composed of a page number and offset), the MMU uses the **page number** to index into the **page table**.
- The MMU retrieves the corresponding **frame number** from the page table.
- The **frame number** is then combined with the **offset** to generate the physical address.

#### **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)**:
To speed up the address translation process, modern systems use a **TLB**, which is a small, fast cache that stores recent page table entries. If the MMU needs to translate a logical address and finds the entry in the TLB, it can quickly compute the physical address without accessing the page table.

---

### **Protection and Sharing in Paging**

1. **Protection**:
   - **Page-level protection** is possible in a paging system by associating protection bits (e.g., read, write, execute) with each page in the page table.
   - These protection bits ensure that processes cannot read or write to memory regions they are not authorized to access, enforcing memory isolation between processes.
   - The **MMU** checks these bits during address translation and raises exceptions (like a segmentation fault or page fault) when a process tries to access memory in violation of the permissions.

2. **Sharing**:
   - **Shared Pages**: Paging allows processes to share memory pages. If multiple processes need to access the same data (e.g., shared libraries), they can be mapped to the same frame in physical memory.
   - The **page table** of each process will contain an entry pointing to the same physical frame, enabling efficient sharing of data.
   - The OS must ensure proper synchronization when processes share memory, especially if some processes modify the shared data.

---

### **Disadvantages of Paging**

1. **Overhead of Page Table**:
   - A page table is required for each process, which introduces overhead in terms of both memory (for storing the page table) and CPU time (for translating addresses).
   - For large processes with a large address space, the page table can become quite large.

2. **Internal Fragmentation**:
   - Even though paging helps avoid external fragmentation, it can still lead to **internal fragmentation**. If a process doesn't fully utilize the last page allocated to it, the leftover space in that page is wasted.

3. **Page Table Access Time**:
   - Every time a logical address is accessed, the MMU must consult the page table to obtain the physical address. This introduces **memory latency**, which can affect system performance.
   - The **TLB** mitigates this issue, but if the TLB miss rate is high, it can still cause significant delays.

4. **Complexity of Handling Multiple-Level Page Tables**:
   - In systems with large address spaces, multiple-level page tables are required to efficiently manage the page-table memory. This adds to the complexity of memory management and introduces more overhead.

5. **Thrashing**:
   - If the system doesn't have enough physical memory to hold all pages of all processes, it may spend a lot of time swapping pages in and out of disk, leading to a phenomenon called **thrashing**. This severely degrades system performance.

Paging is a powerful memory management technique that provides efficient use of memory and solves the problem of external fragmentation, but it also introduces overhead and potential performance issues, particularly with large address spaces.

### **Virtual Memory: Basics and Hardware Control Structures**

**Virtual memory** is a memory management technique that gives the illusion to users of a very large (main) memory, even if the physical memory is smaller. Virtual memory allows programs to run without needing to fit entirely into physical memory, which helps with multitasking, efficient use of memory, and running large applications.

In simpler terms, virtual memory enables a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage. This process is largely invisible to the user and applications.

---

### **Basics of Virtual Memory**

Virtual memory operates by using **paging** or **segmentation** (or a combination of both), creating a mapping between virtual addresses used by a process and physical addresses in the computer’s memory. With virtual memory, each process thinks it has its own contiguous block of memory, but in reality, the data may be scattered across physical memory and secondary storage (e.g., hard drives or SSDs).

#### **Key Concepts of Virtual Memory**:
1. **Virtual Address Space**: Every process is given the illusion of a contiguous and private address space. This virtual space is divided into pages (in the case of paging) or segments (in the case of segmentation).
2. **Physical Address Space**: The actual RAM available to the system is divided into **frames** (in paging) or **blocks** (in segmentation).
3. **Page Table (for Paging)**: A data structure that maps virtual addresses (pages) to physical addresses (frames) in memory.
4. **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)**: A cache used to speed up address translation between virtual and physical memory.
5. **Disk as Virtual Memory**: When physical memory is full, the operating system can swap parts of the process out to secondary storage (disk) in a process known as **paging out**. These swapped-out sections are brought back into memory when needed (**paging in**).

---

### **Hardware Support for Virtual Memory**

The hardware plays a significant role in implementing and managing virtual memory, mainly through the **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**. Here's a breakdown of how hardware structures work in the context of virtual memory:

#### **1. Memory Management Unit (MMU)**
- The **MMU** is a hardware component responsible for translating virtual addresses to physical addresses. It works closely with the page table and TLB to map virtual memory to physical memory efficiently.
- The MMU performs address translation for every memory access made by a program.
- It typically uses **paging** or **segmentation** to break down memory into smaller, manageable parts.
- The MMU can handle multiple page tables and is capable of triggering **page faults** (when a page is not in memory) for the operating system to handle.

#### **2. Page Table**
- The **page table** stores the mappings of virtual addresses to physical addresses. It contains entries, each representing a **virtual page** and its corresponding **physical frame**.
- Each entry in the page table has additional information, such as:
  - **Frame number**: The physical address where the page is located.
  - **Access control bits**: Indicating the permissions (read, write, execute) for the page.
  - **Dirty bit**: Indicates if the page has been modified and needs to be written back to disk if swapped out.
  - **Valid bit**: Tells the MMU whether the page is currently in physical memory or not.

#### **3. Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)**
- The **TLB** is a fast cache that stores the most recently used page table entries. It is a small, high-speed memory within the MMU.
- When the MMU needs to translate a virtual address, it first checks the TLB. If the address translation is present in the TLB (a **TLB hit**), the MMU can quickly generate the physical address. If not (a **TLB miss**), the MMU consults the page table.
- The TLB helps to reduce the time spent on address translation and increases system performance.

#### **4. Segmentation Unit**
- In systems that use **segmentation**, the MMU also uses a **segment table** to map logical segments (e.g., code, data, stack) to physical memory locations.
- Each segment is given a base address and a limit, and these values are stored in a **segment table**.
- **Segmentation** provides a way to view memory from a higher level (logical segments), while **paging** divides memory into equal-sized blocks.
- Some modern systems use a combination of **paging** and **segmentation** for flexibility.

---

### **Control Structures for Virtual Memory**

#### **1. Page Tables**
- Page tables are the primary control structure in systems that use paging. Each process has its own page table to maintain the mapping between virtual and physical addresses.
- In modern systems with **virtual memory**, multiple levels of page tables (e.g., **multi-level paging**) are used to handle large address spaces.

#### **2. Multi-Level Page Tables**
- When a process has a large virtual address space (e.g., a 64-bit address space), a single-level page table would be too large to fit into memory. In such cases, multi-level page tables break down the page table into multiple levels.
- For example, in a 64-bit system, the address is split into multiple parts, each indexing into different levels of page tables. This hierarchy reduces memory usage by allowing the system to allocate pages only as needed.

#### **3. Page Replacement Algorithms**
- When the physical memory is full, the OS uses **page replacement algorithms** to decide which page to swap out to secondary storage. Common algorithms include:
  - **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Swaps out the least recently used page.
  - **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Swaps out the page that has been in memory the longest.
  - **Optimal**: Swaps out the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future (though not practical in most cases because it requires future knowledge).

#### **4. Swap Space**
- When pages are swapped out of memory, they are stored in a designated **swap space** on the disk.
- The **swap space** is a reserved area on the hard drive (or SSD) used to store pages that are not currently in physical memory.
- The **swap file** or **swap partition** holds these pages until they need to be swapped back into memory.

#### **5. Page Fault Handler**
- A **page fault** occurs when the MMU cannot find a mapping for the requested virtual address in physical memory.
- The OS intervenes through the **page fault handler**, which checks if the page is valid and loads it from disk into memory if necessary.
- If a page is not in memory and there is no free space, the page fault handler must also use a page replacement algorithm to free up space.

---

### **Virtual Memory in Action**

Here’s how virtual memory typically works with hardware support:

1. **Process starts**: The operating system allocates a virtual address space for a process, dividing it into pages.
2. **Memory access**: The process accesses a logical address. The MMU checks the page table (via the TLB) to translate the virtual address into a physical address.
3. **Page fault occurs**: If the page is not in memory (TLB miss), the operating system is notified. The OS checks if the page is on disk and swaps it into physical memory.
4. **Page replacement**: If there is no free memory, the OS uses a page replacement algorithm to swap out another page and load the requested page.
5. **Execution continues**: After the page is loaded into memory, the MMU continues translating virtual addresses to physical addresses, and the process executes as normal.

---

### **Summary**

| Concept                      | Description                                              |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Virtual Memory**            | Memory management technique that allows programs to use more memory than physically available by using disk space. |
| **Memory Management Unit (MMU)** | Hardware component that translates virtual addresses to physical addresses using the page table. |
| **Page Table**                | Data structure that maps virtual pages to physical frames. |
| **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)** | High-speed cache used to store the most recent translations of virtual addresses to physical addresses. |
| **Page Fault Handler**        | OS component responsible for handling page faults and swapping pages between disk and physical memory. |
| **Swap Space**                | Disk space used for swapping pages when physical memory is full. |
| **Segmentation Unit**         | Hardware responsible for mapping logical segments (e.g., code, stack) to physical memory. |

Virtual memory allows for efficient memory usage and multitasking, and hardware support (MMU, TLB, etc.) plays a critical role in optimizing performance and managing resources.

### **Locality of Reference**

**Locality of Reference** refers to the tendency of a program to access a relatively small set of memory locations repeatedly over a short period of time. Locality can be classified into two types:

1. **Temporal Locality**: If a memory location is accessed, it is likely to be accessed again soon. For example, a loop accessing the same variable multiple times.
2. **Spatial Locality**: If a memory location is accessed, nearby memory locations are likely to be accessed soon. For example, accessing an array sequentially.

Locality of reference plays a key role in optimizing the performance of virtual memory systems by reducing the need for frequent page swaps between RAM and disk.

---

### **Page Fault**

A **page fault** occurs when a process attempts to access a page that is not currently in memory. The Memory Management Unit (MMU) triggers a page fault when it cannot find a valid mapping for the virtual address in the page table.

**Page Fault Handling Process**:
1. **Check page table**: The MMU checks if the virtual page is in physical memory.
2. **Access the disk**: If the page is not in memory, the operating system must fetch it from secondary storage (usually disk).
3. **Page replacement (if necessary)**: If there is no free memory, a page replacement algorithm is used to free up space by swapping a page out to disk.

Page faults incur significant performance overhead, so minimizing page faults is crucial for system performance.

---

### **Working Set**

The **working set** of a process refers to the set of pages that are actively being used by the process within a certain time window. The idea is to keep the "working set" of pages in memory, so that the process can continue executing without incurring frequent page faults.

The **working set window** is a time period over which the process's pages are observed. Pages that are accessed within this window form the working set.

A working set can help manage the number of pages in memory and prevent **thrashing**, which occurs when the system spends more time swapping pages in and out of memory than executing actual instructions.

---

### **Dirty Page / Dirty Bit**

- **Dirty Page**: A page is considered **dirty** if it has been modified since it was loaded into memory. When a page is swapped out, it needs to be written back to disk if it is dirty, to preserve the changes made by the process.

- **Dirty Bit**: This is a flag (or bit) in the page table entry associated with each page. It indicates whether a page has been modified (written to) since it was loaded into memory. If the dirty bit is set, the page is marked as dirty and must be written to disk when swapped out.

---

### **Demand Paging**

**Demand paging** is a virtual memory management scheme where a page is only loaded into memory when it is accessed for the first time (i.e., when a page fault occurs). This contrasts with **pre-paging**, where pages are loaded into memory before they are accessed.

In demand paging, only the pages that are required by the process are brought into memory, making more efficient use of physical memory and reducing the time spent loading unnecessary pages.

---

### **Page Replacement Algorithms**

Page replacement algorithms are used to decide which page to swap out of memory when a page fault occurs and there is no free memory available. Here are some common page replacement algorithms:

#### **1. Optimal (OPT)**
The **Optimal** page replacement algorithm, also known as **MIN (Minimum),** selects the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future. It minimizes the number of page faults.

- **Disadvantage**: It is **not practical** because it requires knowledge of future memory references, which is generally unavailable.

#### **2. First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**
The **FIFO** page replacement algorithm selects the page that has been in memory the longest and swaps it out when a page fault occurs. This algorithm is simple and easy to implement.

- **Disadvantage**: FIFO suffers from the **Belady’s Anomaly**, where increasing the number of page frames can actually increase the number of page faults in some cases.

#### **3. Second Chance (SC)**
The **Second Chance** algorithm is an enhancement of FIFO. It operates similarly to FIFO but gives pages a "second chance" before swapping them out. Each page has a reference bit, which is initially set to 0. When a page is accessed, the reference bit is set to 1. When a page is selected for replacement, if its reference bit is 1, it is given a second chance and the reference bit is reset to 0.

- **Process**:
  1. The pages are arranged in a circular queue.
  2. When a page needs to be replaced, if the reference bit is 1, the page gets a second chance (reference bit is reset to 0).
  3. If the reference bit is 0, the page is replaced.

#### **4. Not Recently Used (NRU)**
The **NRU** algorithm is a simple page replacement algorithm where the pages are classified based on their **accessed** and **modified** status. Pages are either "recently used" or "not recently used." When a page fault occurs, the algorithm selects the page that is "not recently used" and swaps it out.

- **Process**: Pages are classified based on two bits:
  - **Accessed bit**: Indicates whether the page has been recently accessed.
  - **Dirty bit**: Indicates whether the page has been modified.

  The pages are then prioritized for replacement based on whether they are dirty or accessed recently.

#### **5. Least Recently Used (LRU)**
The **LRU** page replacement algorithm swaps out the page that has not been used for the longest time. This algorithm relies on the assumption that pages that have been used recently are likely to be used again soon.

- **Implementation**:
  - One way to implement LRU is by keeping a **queue** of pages in memory and updating their position each time they are accessed.
  - Another way is by using a **counter** to keep track of the order in which pages are accessed.

- **Disadvantage**: LRU can be expensive to implement due to the need for keeping track of the access history of all pages.

### **Summary of Page Replacement Algorithms**

| Algorithm            | Description                                           | Advantage                              | Disadvantage                            |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Optimal (OPT)**     | Selects the page that will not be used for the longest time. | Provides the minimum number of page faults. | Requires future knowledge, impractical. |
| **FIFO**              | Replaces the oldest page in memory.                   | Simple to implement.                   | Can cause **Belady’s Anomaly**, less efficient in some cases. |
| **Second Chance (SC)**| FIFO with a "second chance" based on reference bit.   | More efficient than FIFO.              | Still not as optimal as LRU or OPT.    |
| **NRU**               | Pages are classified based on accessed and dirty bits. | Simple and quick to implement.         | Not as precise as LRU in selecting the least recently used pages. |
| **LRU**               | Replaces the page that hasn't been used for the longest time. | Provides a good approximation of OPT. | Can be costly to implement.            |
